## The Game

**Pac-Line x 8** is a 4K, one button, up to eight simultaneous players Pac-Line game for the Atari 2600. 

## Controls
### Paddles
If you have a QuadTari, plug it into the two ports of the console and plug the paddles into the four ports of the QuadTari **before** you switch on the console. 

Without a QuadTari, plug the paddles into left and right ports of the console.

### Switches
On the title screen or any time during the game, press **Select** to select a game variation. There are 8 game variations, 4 different starting lines each, without or with bonus items (fruits). The currently selected variation's starting line number is displayed at the top of the screen.

To start a new game press **Reset**. Or **Fire** while not in a running game.

## Playing the Game
### Start Countdown
After pressing **Reset** or **Fire**, a short countdown starts. During this countdown, each player must press the paddle fire button to activate her/his lines for the game. Activated lines are displayed colored and with their pellets enabled.

Immediately after the countdown the game starts. Inactive Pac-Men will be controlled by the game's AI.

### The Game
Your Pac-Man will automatically move right. To move left, hold the fire button. The main goal is to clear all pellets of your line without getting caught by a ghost. Unlike your Pac-Man, the ghosts cannot wrap around. If you eat a bigger power pellet, you can start chasing the ghost for a limited time. The ghost will start to flash when the time expires. Also you can earn extra points by eating a bonus item. 

After clearing a line, a new line with all pellets reenabled appears. Each new line is a little faster and more difficult. The game ends when all human controlled Pac-Men have been caught by a ghost or reached 9,999 points.

### Scoring
The row number and score of the current leading player is displayed at the top of the screen, alternating with the current line number and using the player's color.

Points are awarded for each eaten or caught object as follows:
- pellet: 1 point  
- power pellet: 5 points
- ghost: 10 points
- bonus item: 10..500 points

### High Scores
When the game is over, the high score of the current game variation will be displayed first in white. Then all active player's results will be displayed one by one, ordered by their rank and using the player's color. For each player, there will be two displays:

1. rank & score (e.g. "1. 1234")
2. player number and line (e.g. "4 Ln.17")

The high score will be reset when the game variation is changed.
