## The Game

**Pac-Lines x 8** is a 4K, one button, up to eight simultaneous players Pac-Line game for the Atari 2600. 

## Controls
### Paddles
If you have a QuadTari, plug it into the two ports of the console and plug the paddles into the four ports of the QuadTari **before** you switch on the console. 

Without a QuadTari, plug the paddles into left and right ports of the console.

### Switches
On the title screen or any time during the game, press **Select** to select a game variation. There are 8 game variations, 4 different starting lines without fruits and 4 with fruits. The currently selected variation is at the top of the screen.

To start a new game press **Reset**. Or **Fire** while not in a running game.

## Playing the Game
### Start Countdown
After pressing **Reset** (or the top player's button), a short countdown starts. During this countdown, each player must press the paddle button to activate her/his lines for the game. Activated lines are displayed colored and with their pellets enabled.

Immediately after the countdown the game starts. Inactive Pac-Men will be controlled by the game's AI (still a lot TODO).

### The Game
Your Pac-Man will automatically move right. To move left, hold the fire button. The main goal is to clear all pellets of your line without getting caught by a ghost. Unlike your Pac-Man, the ghosts cannot wrap around. If you eat a bigger power pellet, you can start chasing the ghost for a limited time. And you can earn bonus points by eating a fruit. 

After clearing a line, a new line with all pellets reenabled appears. Each new line is a little faster and more difficult. The game ends when all human controlled Pac-Men have been caught by a ghost.

### High Scores
Before the start of a game and when the game is over, the high score and the line number will be displayed, alternating with the players' scores. The high score will be reset when you change the variation.
